      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>RouteEat started in 2023 when our founder, during a long bus journey, experienced the common traveler's dilemma - limited food options, uncertain quality, and inconvenient stops. This sparked the idea to create a platform that would solve this problem for millions of travelers across India.</p>
      
      <p>What began as a simple concept has now grown into a comprehensive platform connecting travelers with quality restaurants along their routes. We've partnered with hundreds of restaurants, ensuring that every meal meets our high standards of quality, hygiene, and taste.</p>
